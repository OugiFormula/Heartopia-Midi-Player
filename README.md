# Heartopia-Midi-Player
a python script allowing you to play music inside of the game heartopia (pc only)

According to the mods of the heartopia discord server, any third party software is against ToS, use this knowing there is a chance you can get banned.
I overall think its a stupid decision considering there are tools out there that help people with disabilities enjoy such games and lets be honest tools like this one are harmless and doesn't give any in game advantage over others in any way, such tools are common in social games with similar instrument systems and many people enjoy the usage of them.

this script supports playing midi files and also physical midi keyboards (only the white keys, I have no experience with midi keyboards so I tried my best to make it work)

feel free to contribute to the code to make it better, I just threw a few days on it, worked for me decently and I just use it when playing with friends.
