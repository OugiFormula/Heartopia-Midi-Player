# Heartopia-Midi-Player
a python script allowing you to play music inside of the game heartopia (pc only)

this script supports playing midi files and also physical midi keyboards (only the white keys, I have no experience with midi keyboards so I tried my best to make it work)

I'm not sure if you can get banned for this, I been using it the moment I got my instruments and so far nothing happened however I will not be responsible if something happens to your account when using the script.

feel free to contribute to the code to make it better, I just threw a few hours on it, worked for me decently and I just use it when playing with friends.
